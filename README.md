# Airlift Northwest Elevate: Delivering lifesaving care, faster.
[Live](http://test.elevate.airliftnw.org/)

Elevate is a mission-critical, high-availability application for Airlift Northwest emergency flight nurses and pilots in Washington and Alaska. These professionals transport severely ill or injured patients by airplane and helicopter to reach lifesaving medical treatment. We bridge the communication gap between the dispatch center on the ground and flight crews in the air by displaying real-time mission status. Elevate ensures flight crews arrive at the right location with the equipment and information needed to immediately administer lifesaving patient care.
